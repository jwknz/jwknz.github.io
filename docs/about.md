# About Me

<br>

After having completed my Bachelor of Science in Applied Computing I have been teaching on teaching on the program. I have tought software development which cover beginner C# to UWP and Xamarin Mobile Development.<br><br>

My big interest lie in web development technologies for both web and desktop software.<br><br>

While in my teaching role I introduced modern technologies like Git and Docker, these technologies are not very common within the education-sphere, but I felt that it was important for graduates to know and have experience with these technologies before heading into the industry.<br><br>

Teaching at the start of my career was not really the intention, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. But I also know that in this space I am not able to extend myself as a developer, which is what I would like to do. I love to innovate and think outside the box.<br><br>

# The next step

<br>

I am looking for a web developer job and a new adventure to stretch my knowledge in this field.<br><br>

My interests lie in creating functional and good looking websites and applications. I am wanting to work with a team that would like to do the same.<br><br>

Over the last 3 years I have taught classes from introductory programming in C# to creating complete CMS applications in PHP using a custom MVC framework. I have a strong interest in Javascript, NodeJS and looking into React and React-Native is my next hobby.<br><br>

I am a team player, like to innovate and think outside  the box to find solutions. I am a member of the ITP here in Tauranga and have served as a committee member for a number of years. Integrity and honesty are a big part of my character. <br><br>
